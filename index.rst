======================

<**October 2022 Release**>

Welcome to the openIMIS technical documentation repository.

openIMIS is a versatile open source software which supports the administration of health financing and social protection schemes. It is specially designed to manage the complex, high-volume data flows which are required to operate such schemes by seamlessly integrating beneficiary, provider and payer data in a single platform.

This manual is a guide on the use and functionality of the software rather than in-depth technical reference. The Contents section, provide a reference to the page of each major chapter and the sub chapters within. By clicking on the content title (online version), the reader is re-directed to the position of the content title.

   - **Item** means an item in a drop down list,
   - ``LABEL`` means a data field or a button,
   - _NAME_OF_PAGE_ means a name of page or a data field in a text without hyperlink.
