Health Facilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The register of health facilities contains all health facilities contracted and/or eligible for submitting of claims by/to the health insurance scheme. Health Facility administration is restricted to users with the system role of Scheme Administrator or with a role including an access to Administration/Health Facilities.

Pre-conditions
""""""""""""""

  A health facility may only be added if the management of the scheme administration contracts it or if eligibility of submitting of claims can be derived from the legislation. It may thereafter be edited; however, approval of the management of the scheme administration is required for a change of the pricelists associated with the health facility. Deletion of a health facility normally will occur when a Health Facility stops its activity or the contract with the health facility with the scheme administration is cancelled.
