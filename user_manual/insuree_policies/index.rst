Group/family, Insurees and Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In openIMIS the policies are assigned to group only, if a policy need to be assigned to an individual then a group of one must be created.

Because of this approach, the `Family Overview Page <#family-overview-page>`__ is the starting point to manage, insuree (add, edit), policies(add, edit, renew ...) and contribution
