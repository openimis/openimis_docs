Offline Facilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Facilities available while offline and online in IMIS, are similar with some few differences. The following are the feature wise differences found while using openIMIS in offline mode.

 #. **Login**

    If a user who is logging in is having user role HF Administrator or offline Scheme Administrator and if Heath Facility ID/Scheme Office ID is not set yet, just after clicking login button on the login screen/page, the user will be prompted to enter Health Facility/Scheme Office ID (:numref:`image251`), (:numref:`image252`), only once for that very first time of logging in.

    Extracts
      Extracts Menu leads an offline user to Extracts control panel. Using this panel, an offline user with rights to this panel can import data from online openIMIS to the local offline IMIS, and can also download claims and enrolments prior to upload them to the online IMIS. This panel is divided into five sections (:numref:`image255`), (:numref:`image256`) If an offline user is HF Administrator, section C will contain facility to ``Download Claims``. If an offline user is Offline Scheme Administrator, section C will contain facility to ``Download Enrolments``
