Value

variance
  .. Accept a number which is considered to be a percentage of the current claim value variance. Calculated by dividing the current claim value **(value)** and the average sum **(Average)** of the all claims in the previous year from the current claim date and with the same main diagnosis as that of the current claim, minus one **(1)** and finally multiply by hundred **(100)** to get the percentage variance. I.e **Percentage Variance = \[(Value \/ Average) \– 1\] \* 100** Enter a number by checking the variance checkbox and enter a number on the text field next to checkbox.

  Enable to set a variance arround the ``Value`` specified **Percentage Variance = [(Claim Value \ Filter Value) – 1] \* 100**
