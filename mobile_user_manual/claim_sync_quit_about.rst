Off-line mode of the applications
=================================

The applications IMIS Policies and IMIS Claims require for certain
functions Internet connectivity for communication with the web IMIS.
Other functions of both applications can be used autonomously without
availability of Internet connectivity. There is a possibility to move to
a place where Internet connectivity is ensured only for time when
functions requiring Internet connectivity are used (e.g. initialization
of an application, synchronization etc.) and use autonomous functions in
settings without Internet connectivity. However, this may not be
practical or even possible in all situations. Therefore, there is a
possibility to substitute on-line connection for some functions by
off-line transfer of files from/to the web IMIS. Thus, utilization of
the application in an environment without Internet connectivity is
guaranteed.
