| User Manual â€“ CHF-IMIS apps, relates to the versions 1.3.0 and newer  |
| (see the `Remark <\l>`__)                                             |
|                                                                       |
| **Introduction**                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| The Insurance Management Information System (IMIS) is the web based   |
| software supporting running of health insurance schemes. It includes  |
| functionality for a setup to requirements of health insurance         |
| schemes, administration of policies and policyholders and for claim   |
| processing.                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| The web forms used in IMIS are not adjusted to small screens of       |
| mobile phones and this is one of reasons why IMIS provides            |
| applications on the Android platform that can be used effectively in  |
| the field for preparation and retrieving of data for/from the web     |
| IMIS. There are two applications available that provide essential     |
| functionality for enrolment officers (IMIS Policies) and for claim    |
| administrators (IMIS Claims).                                         |
|                                                                       |
| Both applications allow autonomous preparation of data (enrolment and |
| policy data by IMIS Policies and claim data by IMIS Claims) and their |
| on-line or off-line transfer to/from web IMIS. Principally both       |
| applications can be used also in the environment with no or just      |
| occasional access to Internet.                                        |
|                                                                       |
