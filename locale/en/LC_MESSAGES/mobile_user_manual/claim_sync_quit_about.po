"The applications IMIS Policies and IMIS Claims require for certain "
"functions Internet connectivity for communication with the web IMIS. "
"Other functions of both applications can be used autonomously without "
"availability of Internet connectivity. There is a possibility to move to "
"a place where Internet connectivity is ensured only for time when "
"functions requiring Internet connectivity are used (e.g. initialization "
"of an application, synchronization etc.) and use autonomous functions in "
"settings without Internet connectivity. However, this may not be "
"practical or even possible in all situations. Therefore, there is a "
"possibility to substitute on-line connection for some functions by off-"
"line transfer of files from/to the web IMIS. Thus, utilization of the "
"application in an environment without Internet connectivity is "
"guaranteed."
