"To launch the application IMIS Claims just click on the icon of the "
"application. Users must have a valid code of a claim administrator "
"(entered in the register of claim administrators in the web IMIS) and for"
" selected functionalities must have a valid User Name and Password "
"provided by an administrator of the web IMIS. The User Name data field in"
" login pages is pre-filled with claim administrator code entered while "
"launching the application. The reason is that the web IMIS can create "
"automatically a user record simultaneously with an entry of a new claim "
"administrator into the register of claim administrators. Such "
"automatically created user has its User Name equal to the claim "
"administrator code. However, this pre-filled User Name can re-written by "
"any valid User Name."
