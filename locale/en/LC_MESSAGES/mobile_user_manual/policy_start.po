"To launch the application IMIS Policies just click on the icon of the "
"application. Users must have a valid code of an enrolment officer "
"(present in the register of enrolment officers in the web IMIS) and they "
"must have a valid User Name and Password provided by an administrator of "
"the web IMIS for selected functionalities. The User Name data field in "
"login pages is prefilled with enrolment officer code entered while "
"launching the application. The reason is that the web IMIS can create "
"automatically a user record simultaneously with an entry of a new "
"enrolment officer into the register of enrolment officers. Such "
"automatically created user has its User Name equal to the enrolment "
"officer code. However, this prefilled User Name can re-written by any "
"valid User Name in the application IMIS Policies."
