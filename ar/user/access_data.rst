As access to the Data Warehouse is protected, a user has to get from an administrator of AR-MIS URL of the Data Warehouse for remote access, a userid and a password. A userid may allow access to all data in the Data Warehouse or only to a subset of data corresponding to a specific region, to selected regions, to a specific district or to selected districts.
